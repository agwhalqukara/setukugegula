Us Weekly has affiliate partnerships so we may receive compensation for some links to products and services.</i></p><p>Reviewed by <strong><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Dr. Diana Rangaves, PharmD</a></strong></p><p>An effective skin-care routine starts with a high-quality face wash, and many men are choosing to go for nature-powered formulas made with premium ingredients. Thankfully, plenty of companies have replaced traditional formulas with innovative cleansers infused with naturally derived ingredients. But with so many options on the market, picking the right one for your skin can be difficult. To help you find your ideal match, we’ve created the ultimate guide to the best natural face washes for men.</p><h2>How to Choose the Best Face Wash for Your Needs</h2><p>There are two key factors to consider when picking out a face wash. The first is your skin type. Some cleansers are made to be suitable for all skin types; others are targeted toward meeting the specific needs of different skin types. As you’re browsing through the different options, keep your skin type (dry, oily, combination or sensitive) in mind so you can find a product that will work best for what your skin requires.</p><p>The second factor you need to consider is whether there are any specific concerns you’re looking to target. For example, men with acne-prone skin may look for a cleanser made to unclog pores and banish blemishes. Some men also seek out formulas that can help fade the appearance of hyperpigmentation for a more even skin tone, or exfoliating cleansers that can promote a smoother complexion. Whatever your concerns, choosing a face wash specifically made for your unique needs will help you achieve your skin goals.</p><h2>The Best Natural Face Washes for Men</h2><p>Here’s our ultimate list of the best natural face washes for men. No matter your skin type, specific concerns or budgetary needs, you’ll find an option that fits perfectly in your routine.</p><h3>1. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Blu Atlas Volcanic Ash Face Cleanser</a></h3><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image3-1.png alt="Blu Atlas Volcanic Ash Face Cleanser" width=500 height=500 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>First up on our list is the Volcanic Ash Face Cleanser from premium men’s grooming company Blu Atlas. Ninety-eight percent of the ingredients in this formula are derived from natural origins, so you can feel confident adding this nature-powered cleanser to your routine. It’s also vegan and cruelty-free, and free of sulfates, parabens, phthalates and synthetic fragrances.</p><p>This face wash (which is suitable for all skin types) is designed to gently exfoliate and deeply cleanse the skin while balancing its pH levels for optimal skin health. While it is able to effectively purify and refresh the skin, it does so without stripping away its natural moisture.</p><p>The exfoliating action comes from super-fine volcanic ash particles, which absorb excess oil and impurities to cleanse the skin and refine the pores. These particles work alongside lactobacillus ferment filtrate, an ingredient that supports the skin’s microbiome while soothing and strengthening the complexion. Pomegranate seed oil, which is rich in vitamins, antioxidants and fatty acids, nourishes the skin while protecting it against free radicals and providing anti-inflammatory benefits. The result is refreshed skin that feels soft, hydrated and healthy.</p><p>This cleanser comes in two different scents, which are made using natural fragrances. Prefer to keep things simple? Blu Atlas also has a fragrance-free option.</p><h3>2. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">InstaNatural Vitamin C Cleanser</a></h3><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image2-1.png alt="InstaNatural Vitamin C Cleanser" width=500 height=500 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Vitamin C is a powerful ingredient that deserves a spot in every man’s skin-care routine, and we’re happy to see that it’s the star of this natural face wash from InstaNatural. This ingredient will be helpful for anyone looking to counteract dullness and fade hyperpigmentation for a more even skin tone. It also provides antioxidant and anti-aging effects that any man can benefit from.</p><p>The Vitamin C Cleanser is made for all skin types, and works to refresh the skin while brightening discoloration, improving texture and minimizing signs of aging. It’s vegan and cruelty-free, and doesn’t contain parabens, sulfates or synthetic dyes.</p><p>In addition to vitamin C, this cleanser is formulated with aloe vera, a soothing and lightly hydrating ingredient that leaves the skin feeling soft and comfortable. It’s joined by coconut water, which further hydrates while nourishing the skin, and sugarcane extract, which encourages skin cell turnover to promote a more even tone and texture.</p><p>Additionally, green tea extract provides additional antioxidant benefits, ensuring the skin is protected against the damaging effects of free radicals. Ingredients like chamomile, <i>Centella asiatica</i> and cucumber extract further calm the complexion to minimize irritation.</p><h3>3. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Tata Harper Regenerating Cleanser</a></h3><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image5-1.png alt="Tata Harper Regenerating Cleanser" width=500 height=500 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>If you’re a man who is willing to splurge on a luxury face wash, we recommend the Regenerating Cleanser from Tata Harper, a natural skin-care brand. All ingredients used in the formula are derived from natural origins, and 80% of the ingredients are organic. It’s also made without synthetic chemicals or artificial colors or fragrances.</p><p>This cleanser is infused with 16 botanicals that work in tandem to brighten and improve uneven skin tone while decongesting the pores. It has gentle exfoliating power, using apricot microspheres to buff away dead skin cells and debris. White willow bark (a natural source of beta hydroxy acid) works to unclog pores to diminish blemishes, while phytic acid salt, pomegranate enzymes and sunflower seed oil further remove buildup to purify the skin.</p><p>In addition to these ingredients, the formula is made with coral clay, which draws impurities and excess sebum out of the pores. Bergamot and pink grapefruit further purify the skin and refine the appearance of enlarged pores. Finally, the cleanser is made with a range of ingredients that ensure the skin’s moisture levels are balanced. These include kimchi ferment, crystalline coconut and aloe vera.</p><h3>4. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Andalou Naturals Men Refreshing Face Wash</a></h3><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image4-1.png alt="Andalou Naturals Men Refreshing Face Wash" width=500 height=500 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>One of the best natural face washes for men on a budget is the Refreshing Face Wash from Andalou Naturals.

Those with oily or combination skin typically find that cleansing once in the morning and once at night is best to keep oil levels in check. However, those with dry or sensitive skin may find that only cleansing at night is ideal for their complexion. If you work out or otherwise break a sweat in the morning, it is best to wash your face afterward to sweep away impurities.</p><h3>Can you use an exfoliating face wash daily?</h3><p>This depends on the specific product you are using. There are formulas crafted with low concentrations of chemical exfoliants, such as salicylic, glycolic and lactic acids. These types of face washes are generally considered safe to use daily, although you’ll want to see how your skin reacts and adjust as needed.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>On the other hand, physical scrubs more aggressively exfoliate the skin. It’s generally best to only use these types of exfoliating cleansers once a week, as overuse can damage the barrier and cause irritation and dryness. Ultimately, you’ll want to look at the instructions on the product you’ve chosen, and pay attention to how your skin reacts to determine how frequently you should use it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKCfpXq4tdOhZK6rX6OyuL%2BOm5ysrF2jrrXB0ZqjZp6RmLJuw8Csn56rXaKyr3s%3D</p></content><div></div><section class=sk3-margin-v-full><section class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h"><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><sk3-social><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=%2fthe-best-natural-face-washes-for-men.html&title=The%20Best%20Natural%20Face%20Washes%20for%20Men" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"LinkedIn","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#linkedin"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-best-natural-face-washes-for-men.html&description=The%20Best%20Natural%20Face%20Washes%20for%20Men" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Pinterest","width=800,height=720,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#pinterest"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-best-natural-face-washes-for-men.html&title=The%20Best%20Natural%20Face%20Washes%20for%20Men" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Reddit","width=832,height=624,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#reddit"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//t.me/share/url?url=%2fthe-best-natural-face-washes-for-men.html&title=The%20Best%20Natural%20Face%20Washes%20for%20Men" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Telegram","width=800,height=600,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#telegram"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//twitter.com/intent/tweet/?url=%2fthe-best-natural-face-washes-for-men.html&text=The%20Best%20Natural%20Face%20Washes%20for%20Men" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Twitter","width=800,height=450,resizable=yes,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#twitter"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//vk.com/share.php?url=%2fthe-best-natural-face-washes-for-men.html" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"VK","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#vk"/></svg></a></sk3-social></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><div class=sk3-margin-h><h3>Reinaldo Massengill</h3></div><div class="sk3-margin-h sk3-margin-down">Update: 2024-07-22</div></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./controversy-rages-over-fatal-adam-johnson-hit-as-video-surfaces.html><h3>&lt;&lt; Controversy rages over fatal Adam Johnson hit as video surfaces</h3></a><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./mtv-roadies-season-19-full-episode-22nd-july-2023-watch-prince-narula-gautam-gulati-fight.html><h3>MTV Roadies season 19 full episode 22nd July 2023: Watch Prince Narula &amp;amp; Gautam Gulati fight >></h3></a></div></div></section></section><div></div></div></div><footer class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h sk3-margin-v-full sk3-pad-v-full"><div class="sk3-pad-h txt-center-h">©
